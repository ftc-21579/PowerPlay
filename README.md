# Contributing
You can help contribute to this repository by first cloning the repository using the GitHub CLI or by clicking the big green download button and selecting `.zip`.  

All of our code is located in the `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/` folder. In this folder there are two primary folders, `auton` and `tele`, they represent the different types of opmodes included inside them. Please ensure that your opmode is located in the correct folder.

Go ahead and change whatever code you need to, and then when you're done, make a Pull Request. Ensure that your branch name is not master, please name the branch after whatever the primary feature/bugfix that your code does. Do not merge it by yourself, wait for someone else to review it. **Do not submit a pull request without testing your code first.**

That is it!
